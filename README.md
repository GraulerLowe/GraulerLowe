Hi, I’m Gael Arturo León García and I'm a student of Computer Science at the Faculty of Sciences at UNAM.
- I like to learn about Linux, all kinds of customization of desktop environments, window managers and developing scripts for certain functions.
- I have a great interest in mental health care and its importance in society.
- I'm interested in meeting people and, if possible, engaging in health-focused computing activities.
- I want to get people to learn to help themselves.
